# JSON-Builder
JavaFx application for creating/modifying JSON context packs

This program is designed to create Contextpacks for the University of Minnesota Morris's StoryBuilder project. It's aim is to be a user-friendly interface to manually enter values to construct a 'ContextPack' in JSON form.

The application was developed in using an interface called 'SceneBuilder' (by Gluon). It's free to download, and is a good alternative to the analog interface that Oracle no longer supports (at least at the time of writing this).
